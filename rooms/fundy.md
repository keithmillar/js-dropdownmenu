We just love this room and this is our most popular room with our repeat visitors. The Fundy View room is spacious with vibrant colours creating a warm relaxing sexy atmosphere, ideal for a romantic break or a long weekend away from the hustle and bustle of life. Welcome to our new feature room with lovely views over Seely Street and looking towards the Bay of Fundy with Mispec and Red Head in the distance. Enjoy a luxurious bath in our Whirlpool tub or step into our large seperate shower cubicle with vanity. The bedroom is spacious and full of style and character and decorated with a Queen Bed and Walk-in closet. Enjoy a movie in our DVD Television or just relax and enjoy the room with a mug of Hot Chocolate.
